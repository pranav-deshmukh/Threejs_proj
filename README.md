Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

You can use this project as a reference .

Bruno Simon's portfolio might be updated over time as well, so feel free to download the version downloaded in the video by copying the `src/folio` folder. Please note that the files inside of that folder might be edited slightly in the videos to keep things working. The unedited version can be found [here](https://github.com/sjoerdvanBommel/threeveloper/tree/011-bruno-simon-portfolio-introduction/src/folio).
